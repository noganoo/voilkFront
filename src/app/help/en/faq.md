# General

## <span id="What_is_Voilknetwork_com">What is voilk.com?</span>

Voilknetwork has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, and growing social economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It's a new kind of attention economy.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Voilknetwork_work">How does Voilknetwork work?</span>

Voilk.com is the only website that is powered by the Voilk blockchain and VOILK cryptocurrency. It read and write content to the Voilk blockchain, which stores the content in an immutable blockchain ledger, and rewards users for their contributions with digital tokens called VOILK.

Every day, the Voilk blockchain mints new VOILK tokens and adds them to a community's "rewards pool". 
You can see how much VOILK in reward pool by visiting properties tab on [Explorer](https://explorer.voilk.com/).
These tokens are then awarded to users for their contributions, based on the votes that their content receives. Users who hold more tokens in their account as "Voilk Power" will get to decide where a larger portion of the rewards pool is distributed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Voilknetwork_differ_from_other_social_media_websites">How does Voilknetwork differ from other social media websites?</span>

While most social media sites extract this value for the benefit of their shareholders, Voilknetwork believes that the users of the platform should receive the benefits and rewards for their attention and the contributions they make to the platform.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_need_to_do_in_order_to_secure_my_account">What do I need to do in order to secure my account?</span>

Unlike most social media websites, **there is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / owner key!** This is why it is extremely important that you save and backup your password somewhere safe. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper stored in a fireproof safe. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

If you leak your private key to another user or a third-party website, that user or website will have full access to your account. This means they can steal it, as well as the funds inside of it. It is therefore not recommended to enter your private key information with any other user or third-party website. If you believe your account has been compromised, you should change your password/keys right away.

Each account has multiple keys, which each have different levels of authority: owner, active, posting, and memo. The information on the different types of keys and their purposes, as well as more information on password and key security, can be found in the section on <a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">Security</a>.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Does_it_cost_anything_to_post__comment__or_vote">Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?</span>

No. It is free to post, comment, and vote on content on voilk.com. You might even get paid for it!

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_Voilknetwork_How">Can I earn digital tokens on Voilknetwork? How?</span>

## <span id="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from">Where do the tokens come from?</span>

The Voilk network continually creates new digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Voilk by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Voilk Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_does_the_value_come_from">Where does the value come from?</span>

At its root, Voilk is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Voilk-related services.

By analogy, Voilk is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards">Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</span>

Voilknetwork is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.

Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.

It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Is_there_a_desktop_wallet_available_for_VOILK">Is there a desktop wallet available for VOILK?</span>

No. Currently it is not available.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_Smart_Media_Tokens_SMTs">What are Smart Media Tokens (SMTs)?</span>

A Smart Media Token (SMT) is a native digital asset on the Voilk blockchain that can be quickly launched by anyone to help monetize online content and create incentives to encourage desired user behavior.

They're like Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens, but with certain built-in ‘Proof-of-Brain’ properties and a token distribution reward system designed specifically for digital content businesses.

SMTs are planned to be launched in 2020!

## <span id="Am_I_required_to_verify_my_identity">Am I required to verify my identity?</span>

Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.

There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Voilknetwork profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.

Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Voilk account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.

Be mindful when choosing tags. If your tags aren’t related to your post, your post may get downvotes for mistagging.

# Economics

## <span id="Where_do_the_new_VOILK_tokens_come_from">Where do the new VOILK tokens come from?</span>

Blockchains like Voilk and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Voilk blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund called the "rewards pool". The rewards pool gives users tokens for participating in the platform based on the value they add.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_new_tokens_are_generated_by_the_blockchain">How many tokens were generated by the blockchain?</span>

## <span id="What_is_the_reward_pool">What is the reward pool?</span>

Every day, a fixed amount of VOILK tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_reward_pool_split_between_authors_and_curators">How is the reward pool split between authors and curators?</span>

Reward pool is split between authors and curators

## <span id="Will_the_reward_pool_pay_out_more_or_less_depending_on_who_votes">Will the reward pool pay out more or less depending on who votes?</span>

There is a fixed amount of VOILK coins that gets added to the rewards pool each day. In the short term, the amount of coins that get paid out may be higher or lower depending on the amount of voting activity, but over time it will pay out the full amount of rewards regardless of who votes.

Votes in Voilk are stake-weighted. Therefore voters with more Voilk Power have a greater influence over the allocation than voters with less SP, but their votes do not increase the amount of rewards in the rewards pool.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Why_do_the_earnings_for_my_post_go_up_or_down">Why do the earnings for my post go up or down?</span>

The amount that is shown next to a post is a "**Potential Payout**". This is an estimated value of how much money the post will make based on the votes that have occurred so far. Depending on various factors, this value can go up or down until the payout window closes:

- If a post receives more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If a post receives more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If upvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If downvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If the price of VOILK goes up, the potential payout of all posts can go up.
- If the price of VOILK goes down, the potential payout of all posts can go down.

## <span id="What_is_delegated_VOILK_Power">What is delegated Voilk Power?</span>

Users have the option to delegate Share Power to other users. When a user is delegated Share Power - their bandwidth, content votes, and curation rewards are calculated as if it were their own Share Power.

## <span id="What_determines_the_price_of_VOILK">What determines the price of VOILK?</span>

The price of VOILK is based on the supply and demand of the token, as determined by buyers and sellers on the exchanges. It is similar to how the price of a commodity like gold is determined.

## <span id="How_do_I_get_more_VOILK_Power">How do I get more Voilk Power?</span>

With VOILK tokens in your wallet, click "Power Up" to turn them into Voilk Power. If you have Voilk Dollars, you can convert them to VOILK from your wallet, and then power up the VOILK.

If you don’t already have VOILK or Voilk Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase them using bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC).

To buy:
- contact us via email support@voilk.com, use Purchase Voilknetwork as title of email.

Transactions on the Voilk blockchain typically only take about three seconds to process, but when you are purchasing the VOILK tokens using bitcoin or some other token, then the transaction must wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the other network. This can take several hours, and sometimes even days.    

If you paid using bitcoin, the third party website <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">bitcoinfees.21.co</a> can estimate the approximate wait time of the transaction based on the fees that were paid. The third party website <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> will lookup the fees that were paid on a specific blockchain transaction.

## <span id="What_is_powering_up_and_down">What is powering up and down?</span>

**Powering up** - If you have VOILK tokens, you can Power Up to Voilk Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more Voilk Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and new coined tokens that you can earn. More SP also grants more influence on approving Voilk witnesses.

**Powering down** - If you have Voilk Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid VOILK over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/104 of your Voilk Power to VOILK each week for about 26 months (104 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.

## <span id="What_do_the_dollar_amounts_for_pending_payouts_represent">What do the dollar amounts for pending payouts represent?</span>

The dollar amounts next to posts and comments are estimates of the potential payout that will occur when the payout period ends, based on the current voting activity and price of VOILK. These potential payout amounts may fluctuate up or down until the payout period ends.

Payouts occur as a combination of Voilk Power and Voilk Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute VOILK in place of the Voilk Dollars based on market conditions.

The blockchain estimates the dollar value of VOILK and Voilk Power based on the 3.5 day average price of VOILK reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Voilk Dollars are worth approximately one USD.

## <span id="Will_1_Voilk_Dollar_always_be_worth__1_00_USD">Will 1 Voilk Dollar always be worth $1.00 USD?</span>

The market value of a Voilk Dollar is dictated by the supply and demand of the token. Therefore it is possible for 1 VSD to be worth more or less than 1 USD depending on market conditions.

# Voting and Curating

## <span id="What_is_my_voting_power">What is my voting power?</span>

Voting power is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that goes down a little bit every time you vote. You start out with 100% voting power. Every time you vote, you will use a small amount of your voting power.

As you use more of your voting power, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting power left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting power. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting power every day.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_times_can_I_vote_without_depleting_my_voting_power">How many times can I vote without depleting my voting power?</span>

Every 100% vote you cast will use 1% of your remaining voting power. . You can vote more than 20 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_vote_with_less_than_100__of_my_voting_strength">Can I vote with less than 100% of my voting strength?</span>

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting strength.

Once you reach about 500 Voilk Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.

<img src="https://voilknetworkimages.com/DQmV6c21tzSrgXwPHx4tvuc1UiCXBEvzkLBH9QCZHtVN6Ma/image.png">

Upvotes and downvotes use the same amount of voting power.

## <span id="What_determines_how_much_of_the_curation_reward_goes_to_the_author_versus_curators">What determines how much of the curation reward goes to the author versus curators?</span>

The rewards are allocated so that 75% of the payout goes to the author of the post/comment, and 25% goes to the curator.

Of the 25% that goes to the curator, that portion will be split between the author and the curator if the curator votes within the first 30 minutes. The split of the 25% between the author and curator during the first 30 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.

- If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the author.
- At 3 minutes, 90% goes to the author and 10% to the curator.
- At 15 minutes it's a 50/50 split.
- At 27 minutes, 10% goes to the author and 90% to the curator.
- If a post is upvoted 30 min after posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the curator.

## <span id="Do_I_get_curation_rewards_for_downvoting_posts_or_comments">Do I get curation rewards for downvoting posts or comments?</span>

No. Since downvoting reduces the rewards on a post/comment, it does not earn curation rewards.

## <span id="Why_don_t_my_upvotes_have_an_effect_on_a_post_s_rewards">Why don't my upvotes have an effect on a post's rewards?</span>

A user with more SP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less SP. One vote from a user with a lot of SP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of SP.

Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.

## <span id="Is_there_a_way_to_make_my_votes_count_for_more">Is there a way to make my votes count for more?</span>

Yes. The more Voilk Power you have, the more influence your votes will have.

The platform does not require that anybody purchase SP in order to participate, and there are many users who have earned a lot of Voilk Power without spending any of their own money. You have the option of purchasing more Voilk Power through your Voilknetwork wallet.

## <span id="What_are_the_valid_reasons_for_downvoting">What are the valid reasons for downvoting?</span>

Users are allowed to downvote for any reason that they want. There are many users in the community who recommend only using the downvote on posts that are abusive. It is up to you if you want to follow this etiquette.

## <span id="Does_a_downvote_mean_that_I_did_something_wrong">Does a downvote mean that I did something wrong?</span>

Just because you received a downvote does not mean that you did something wrong. The downvoting person may have just been voting to reallocate the rewards in a way that they felt was more beneficial to the other active posts in the platform. Often users will leave a comment explaining why they downvoted, but sometimes they might not. If they left a reason, it is up to you to determine if you did anything wrong, and if there is anything you want to change.

# Reputation

## <span id="What_is_Reputation">What is Reputation?</span>

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Voilknetwork measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help reduce abuse of the Voilknetwork platform.

Your reputation goes up when accounts vote on your content. Getting downvoted by someone with a higher reputation can push your reputation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with a lower reputation score are unable to affect your reputation.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_Reputation_score_measured">How is the Reputation score measured?</span>

Every new user starts off with a reputation score of 25.

The reputation score is based off of a `log10` system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30.


<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_improve_my_reputation_score">How do I improve my reputation score?</span>

Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. The more Voilk Power that the voter has, the larger the effect is. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Voilknetwork community.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="What_causes_my_reputation_score_to_go_down">What causes my reputation score to go down?</span>

The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user. Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though.

- Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score.
- If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (weighted by SP), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="Why_does_my_reputation_score_matter">Why does my reputation score matter?</span>

A reputation score is one way Voilknetwork measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Voilknetwork, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.

Many Voilkians glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.

It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Voilknetwork will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow Voilkians.

# Blockchain

## <span id="What_is_a_blockchain">What is a blockchain?</span>

A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name "blockchain".

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_Voilk_blockchain">What is the Voilk blockchain?</span>

The Voilk blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_bandwidth_work_on_the_Voilk_blockchain">How does bandwidth work on the Voilk blockchain?</span>

Since transacting on the Voilk blockchain has zero fees, bandwidth rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Everything action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of bandwidth. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume bandwidth.

Every user has a limited amount of bandwidth to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less bandwidth they will have left (until it recharges). Users with more Voilk Power will have a higher bandwidth allowance.

Normally everyone's bandwidth allowance is quite high, and users are able to use the network freely without any interruptions. Sometimes when the blockchain becomes busy however (due to heavy use), everyone's individual allowances may go down until the network becomes less busy.

You can check how much bandwidth you currently have based on the current limit at:
https://explorer.voilk.com/@youraccount

If users are below their bandwidth limit, they will be unable to transact with the blockchain until their bandwidth recharges or their limit is raised.

If you get an error that you have exceeded your bandwidth allowance, it is normally best to just wait and try again later (when it is less busy). Usually if you wait and try again later, the transaction will likley go through.

If you are unable to transact for extended periods of time, or you are frequently running into bandwidth limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage to stay within your limit, or purchase more Voilk Power for your account.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Voilk_and_Voilknetwork">What is the difference between Voilk and Voilknetwork?</span>

Voilk is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. VOILK is also a name for the system’s value token (currency).

Voilknetwork is a front end web interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data. Voilknetwork is also the name of the company that owns and operates the website voilk.com.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_Voilk_different_from_Bitcoin">How is Voilk different from Bitcoin?</span>

On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Voilk is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses "witnesses" instead of "miners" to produce blocks.

The "delegated proof of stake" model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Voilk blockchain, only 10% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 90% of new VOILK coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and Voilk Power holders.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Proof_of_Work__Proof_of_Stake__and_Delegated_Proof_of_Stake">What is the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake?</span>

**Proof of work** - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so.

**Proof of stake** - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network.

**Delegated proof of stake** - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Voilk stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Voilk network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds.

## <span id="Did_Voilknetwork__pre_mine__tokens">Did Voilknetwork "pre-mine" tokens?</span>

Yes. 900 Million tokens were premined. @voilknetwork account holds them.
These tokens are mostly used to fund new accounts, bounty programs, providing liquidity to market, payment to voilknetwork team. Every transaction that goes out of @voilknetwork account has a Memo part which tells what purpose it is used.

# Security

## <span id="How_can_I_keep_my_Voilk_account_secure">How can I keep my Voilk account secure?</span>

<b>Save your master password and keep it somewhere safe.</b>

Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing:
- Posting key for every day logins
- Active key when necessary for transfers, power ups, etc.
- Master password or owner key when changing the password

Again, <b>save your master password</b> and keep it safe! If logging in with your post key, make sure you don't overwrite or misplace your original master password.

It is not recommended to share your password or keys with any third party site. Voilknetwork is developing a login application that can be used on third party Voilk front ends.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_should_I_be_careful_with_my_master_password">Why should I be careful with my master password?</span>

The master password is used to derive all keys for your account, including the owner key. If someone has access to your master password, they can steal your account and all of the tokens in it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_is_the_master_password_a_long_string_of_gibberish">Why is the master password a long string of gibberish?</span>

The password has to be long and random for maximum account security.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_my_different_keys_for">What are my different keys for?</span>

**Posting key** - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, revoilk, and follow or mute other accounts. Most users should be logging into Voilknetwork every day with the posting key. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause.

**Active key** - The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Voilk Dollars, voting for witnesses, updating profile details and avatar, and placing a market order.

**Memo key** - Currently the memo key is not used.

**Owner key** - The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_do_if_I_lost_my_password_keys">What do I do if I lost my password/keys?</span>

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password or owner key! Because your account has real value, it is **very important** that you save your master password somewhere safe where you will not lose it.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

No, liquid tokens can not be taken back if stolen or sent to the wrong account.

If your tokens are in Voilk Power, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/104 per week. If your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day wait period for them to become transferable.

# Developers

## <span id="Are_the_Voilk_blockchain_and_Voilknetwork_com_code_open_source">Are the Voilk blockchain and voilk.com code open-source?</span>

Yes. Both the Voilk blockchain and voilk.com are open-source projects.

Developers should however avoid the use of the term "Voilknetwork" in their own products, and instead refer to the Voilk Blockchain or Voilk Platform. Voilknetwork refers to voilk.com, which is owned by @bilalhaider.

# Witnesses

## <span id="What_are_Voilk_witnesses">What are Voilk witnesses?</span>

The Voilk blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by the backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with Voilk Power for each block they create.

The Voilk Whitepaper was written to describe the mechanics of the token system that makes decentralized content incentives and distribution possible in a way that can improve web technologies across the board. It is also applicable to Voilknetwork, the first website to plug into the Voilk blockchain. Users who have read the Voilk Whitepaper will better understand how their interactions with Voilknetwork are interactions with Voilk, the decentralized network.

We will release it soon..
